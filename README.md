## Overview
This project is a Passive Keyless Entry (PKE) car alarm system with a remote start feature. The PKE system allows you to lock and unlock your car doors without using traditional keys, making it more convenient and secure. Additionally, the remote start feature enables you to start the car's engine remotely, which is especially useful for warming up or cooling down the car before entering.
